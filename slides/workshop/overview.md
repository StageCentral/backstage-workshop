# Platform Engineering Defined

Platform engineering is a new discipline that emerged in response to the growing complexity of modern cloud-native architectures. It entails the practice of building and maintaining an integrated product, called an “Internal Developer/Delivery Platform,” which acts as a flexible and well-maintained abstraction layer between the engineers and the underlying technologies of their applications.

The main goal of the Internal Delivery Platform is to enable engineers to be more productive by:
- eliminating waste
- reducing cognitive load
- putting the needed data at their fingertips.

## What's an IDP

- An Internal Delivery *Platform* is the backbone of an organizations delivery process - abstracting away the complexities and providing the tools to get stuff done in the most productive and cost-effective way.

- An Internal Delivery *Portal* (Backstage) is the dashboard of our internal platform - providing and visualizing all the necessary data and enabling the shortest (golden) paths to getting stuff done.

## Components of an IDP

A standard IDP consists of:

- A software catalog (the backbone of the platform - outlining what we have and who owns what)

- A software scaffolder (allowing engineers to quickly build new things)

- Self-service workflows (allowing engineers to quickly provision necessary resources and perform routine tasks)

- Integrations (allowing full visibility and self-service access to all necessary organizational data sources and tools)

## Why Backstage

- Provides an industry standard framework for building an IDP

- Provides the basic features of an IDP out of the box

- Backed by a large and vibrant community

- Highly customizable

## Backstage History

Backstage was created at Spotify in 2016 when the company was growing incredibly quickly and onboarding new engineers was becoming a challenge. 

The project became Spotify’s mission-critical tool for containing software chaos and empowering engineers to work faster and more efficiently. Spotify open-sourced Backstage in March 2020 to share its experience with the broader community.

In March 2022 the CNCF announced that its Technical Oversight Committee (TOC) voted to accept Backstage as a CNCF **incubating** project.
